# Audio & Music Upgrade Plan

This file tracks tasks for "better music" and immersive soundscapes.

## Goal: "Better Music"

### Music Tracks Needed
Current music is basic. We need distinct themes.
- [ ] **Village Theme**: Gentle, acoustic guitar + flute. Relaxing.
- [ ] **Forest/Exploration**: Ambient, subtle drums, wind sounds. slightly mysterious.
- [ ] **Temple/Sacred**: Bells, drone sounds, reverb-heavy. High spiritual vibe.
- [ ] **Night Theme**: Quieter version of Village Theme with crickets.

### Sound Effects (SFX)
- [ ] **Footsteps**: Different sounds for Grass, Wood, Stone.
- [ ] **UI Sounds**: Satisfying "pop" or "click" for menu interaction.
- [ ] **Quest Complete**: A short, uplifting jingle (3-4 seconds).

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] **Music Manager**: Update `js/systems/sound.js` to handle cross-fading between tracks when moving between zones.
- [ ] **Dynamic Volume**: Lower music volume slightly when dialogue is open.
